### Installation  
Follow these steps to set up the Optibuddy ERP Chatbot:  

1. **Install Hexabot CLI**:  
   ```bash  
   npm install -g hexabot-cli  

2. **Create Your Project**:
   Use the Hexabot CLI to create a new chatbot project:

   ```bash
   hexabot create my-chatbot
   ```

3. **Configure Your Environment**:

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and customize it according to your environment and configuration needs.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   Navigate into the newly created folder and run the following command to start the project in development mode:

   ```bash
   hexabot dev
   ```

   For production mode, you can use:

   ```bash
   hexabot start
   ```

   _Note_: The first run may take some time as it needs to download all required Docker images.

5. **Configure your NLU Engine**:
   After creating your new project, the **Hexabot LLM-NLU Engine** will be enabled by default. This NLU engine relies on one of the following LLM helpers being present, you can enable one of these by following the steps detailed in [LLM NLU Engine](https://docs.hexabot.ai/user-guide/nlu/nlu-engines/llm-nlu-engine) documentation page:

   - Ollama Helper (`hexabot-helper-ollama`)
   - Google Gemini Helper (`hexabot-helper-gemini`)
   - OpenAI ChatGPT Helper (`hexabot-helper-chatgpt`)

   You must follow the instructions of the selected LLM helper in their specific documentation before starting the project.

## Built-in Features
